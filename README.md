# SagePost

SagePost is a World of Warcraft 3.3.5a (Ascension-compatible) addon designed to simplify party and raid recruitment by generating clean, consistent LFG posts based on your desired group composition.

Ascension’s classless system makes traditional role assumptions unreliable. SagePost solves this by letting you explicitly define what you’re recruiting for, so players immediately understand your group’s needs.

## Setup

1. Download SagePost.zip from the releases section.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Move the `SagePost` folder to your World of Warcraft AddOns directory. This is usually located at:
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Ascension Launcher\resources\client\Interface\AddOns\`

## Commands

- `/sp` - Opens the SagePost configuration window.
